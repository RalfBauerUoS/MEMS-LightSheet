# MEMS-LightSheet
This repository is under construction and currently in development.

In the folders are details about the material list to build an open-top MEMS-Lightsheet microscope as described in this Scientific Report paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93454-8

Additionally there are 3D-designs, a Labview based control code using either a Thorlabs CS2100M-USB or IDS-3060CP camera and custom electronics details for the control.

## MEMS-LightSheet design
The below 3D-schematic shows the overall setup, excluting the fibre coupled lasers and sample stage.

The 3D parts and full assembly of the shown setup are available in Autodesk Inventor format under [??].

## Part list
The part list can be found in [this pdf].

## Electronics
An overview schematics of the electronics required to drive the piezoelectric dual axis MEMS micromirror and 3mm electrical tunable lens can be found [here].

## MEMS control
Details to be added.
